# BunnyAPI [![codebeat badge](https://codebeat.co/badges/6d7f9114-b2b4-4242-834f-769b9db47c18)](https://codebeat.co/projects/github-com-danner26-bunnyapi-develop)
`BunnyAPI` is a Node.JS/Express.JS simple API that retrieves JSON from the [BunnyScripts](https://github.com/danner26/BunnyScripts) repo by Daniel W. Anner and Gregory Walsh. This project is originally for our CSIS33-3381 with Dr. Aakash Taneja. In working on this project, we have found a new respect and passion for these Bash Bunny scripts. We plan to keep our research going, and continue to upkeep and integrate new features for this API.

## Usage
When using this API, you are free to adapt it for your needs, but it will work best with the tested scripts over in the [BunnyScripts](https://github.com/danner26/BunnyScripts) repo. After following the [wiki setup](https://github.com/danner26/BunnyAPI/wiki/Setup-Install-Guide), you are set to use the API!
